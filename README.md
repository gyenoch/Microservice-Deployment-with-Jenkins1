## Deploying a Modern Microservice Application in using Jenkins[Simple Deployment Setup]

This project demonstrates the deployment of a microservices-based application on an Amazon EKS cluster using Jenkins for automated deployment. The Jenkins pipeline automates the process of applying Kubernetes manifests to the EKS cluster, enabling seamless, scalable deployment of the application. Kubernetes manages the microservices, ensuring reliability and efficient resource use.

## Overview
🛠️ **Tools Explored:** 
Jenkins, Kubernetes, Amazon EKS, AWS CLI

📚 **Key Concepts:**
- Jenkinsfile for pipeline automation
- Kubernetes manifests for microservice deployment
- Amazon EKS for managed Kubernetes
- AWS CLI for cluster management

📈 **Pipeline Stages:**
Deploy Kubernetes resources using kubectl
Verify service deployment
Expose service to the public

📈 **Outcome:** 
Automated, scalable microservices deployment on EKS
